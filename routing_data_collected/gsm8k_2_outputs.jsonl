She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?", "generated": "\n\nLet's calculate this step-by-step:\n\n1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.\n2. She eats three for breakfast every morning, so she has 16 - 3 = <<16-3=13>>13 eggs left.\n3. She bakes muffins for her friends every day with four of those eggs, so she has 13 - 4 = <<13-4=9>>9 eggs left.\n4. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg, so she makes 9 * $2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmers' market. Answer: \\boxed{18}."}
